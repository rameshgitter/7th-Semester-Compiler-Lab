Assignment on Symbol Table Management:--

Consider the assumptions for the language previously considered in last lab sessions. Variables of data types allowed in the subset can be defined at the very beginning of any function / block. A variable must be defined before it is used. Using YACC, define the grammar rules and associated set of actions for the following.


a) Find the data type for each newly created variable and create symbol table by adding the data type and scope information for each declared variable.

Continue the previous assignment and Consider the following assignments on Type Checking. Using YACC, define the grammar rules and associated set of actions for checking following Type expressions:

a)Types of all the sub-expressions in an expression must be of the same type otherwise, show a type error
message.

b) Check whether or not the assignment statement is type correct. The type of left and right side of an
assignment statement must be of similar type, if not similar show type-error with line number. Detect an illegal assignment.

c) Expressions in conditional and while statement, type of all operands must be of the same type. For any
type-error show the error message with line number.

d) Identify memory errors, such as attempting to use an integer as a pointer

e) Type checking for statements like Array declarations.
